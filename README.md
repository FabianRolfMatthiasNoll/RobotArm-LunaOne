## 3D Printing

All necessary Files are attached to this subreddit.

For the "Greifer 1" and "Greifer 2" please print it so that the teeth show up.
You need to set "Supports everywhere" for this to achieve.

All Parts can be printed up to 0.2mm. More than that is not tested, especially the
"Greifer" and "Zahnrad" parts.
